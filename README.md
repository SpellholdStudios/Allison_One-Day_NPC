## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mods adds Allison, a true neutral druid, to Baldur's Gate II/ She is extremely friendly and somewhat playful, and will probably remind you of an overly affectionate Imoen.

&nbsp;

**Content:**
- Party joinable single class druid.
- Voicing.
- Roughly two dozen interjections.
- At least one banter with every party member (most have two).
- ToB Content, including an all-new epilogue.

<details><summary>Original note from the author</summary>
<p>

###### Allison is my contribution to the One-Day NPC Project, found over at <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net">Pocketplane Group</a>. To put it simply, my goal is to see how complete of an NPC I could develop in only a single day. Allison actually took just under eight hours to develop.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-allison.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **allison** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

##

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-allison --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
